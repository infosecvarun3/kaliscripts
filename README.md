# kaliscripts to ease my workflow

Edit target ip to target.txt (should be placed in the same folder).
chmod +x targetip.sh
Make sure xclip is installed to use copy feature.
Add generic monitor on the panel of kali linux and add the command 'bash -c "~/targetip.sh"' 

Now we can see the target ip on the panel and copy it while working on hacking machine like hackthebox etc.

We can always edit the filename and location of the file as per your perferences.
